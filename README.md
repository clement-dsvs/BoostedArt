## General Infos

The project was originally one of our first through our formation at the training center, so it has been spread all across the past three months before the redaction of that readme, which was the 4th of January, one week before the releaase date.
When it comes to the features, I redirect yourself toward the Documentation folder where you should find the Specifications with all the informations on that matter.

All that has to be said there, is that we were originally planifying a website with the core idea of packages/bundles you could buy to inspire yourself on a subject, which could be a global theme such as "Cyberpunk" in which you would find items related to this specific theme, may it be pictures, music, artworks and so on.
The particularity that should distinguish us from our competitors is that the website would end up with users/artists in the capacity of uploading their own bundles and they could gain some money through that process, so if we should put words on that formula, it would be a mix between Deviantart, Humblebundle, and Fiverr.

The evocated release date for the project is the 9th of January.

## Collaborators

The different resources (the project members) were allocated by competence but also by the desire to work on a field, in order to guarantee a certain efficiency in the light of the project.

However, taking into account incidents and deadlines, we have in practice planned to interact with each other on assignments that were not originally ours. 

Our group is strong from a previous experience of cohesion through the "Adeya" project, which was a human resources management tool. 

Laure arrived later, as she joined us in the early days of Boosted'Art, but very quickly found her place to fill in the gaps in our group, which generally split into two sections of expertise: back-end and front-end.

### Clement DESAVIS

> Head of the previous project "ADEYA", Clément is our Swiss Army Knife with knowledge in most fields given his original background. Javascript questions and database reporting were his favourite areas where he was able to coordinate.

### Florian HERMEL

> Florian is our indicated back-end comrade, so he has been arranged together with Clément and Laure on SQL and database issues.

### Enzo DUPONT

> Enzo is one of the two front-end oriented collaborators in charge of the HTML and CSS realisation.

### Laure DELACHAPELLE

> Laure is our bridge between two worlds, she set up the specifications and worked on the different areas with the exception of CSS. So she worked as much with Jeremy for the documentation and with the latter plus Enzo for the front-end, as with Florian and Clément for the back-end.

### Jeremy PROVOST

> Jeremy is the last of our group, with several personal front-end experiences, he has put them to the group's advantage by setting up as a composer of the documentation and the graphic part, including the Logo for example, and has participated in the implementation of the CSS/HTML. He also took care of the implementation of the Gantt for team management.

## Further upgrades

There are many improvements to come, but we still lack the knowledge - and the time - to implement them. 

Among the options being considered are, for example : A optional bundle to change the visual of the website, a promotion page where you could find bundles in said promotion, and a dark mode for those who prefer a darker design.
