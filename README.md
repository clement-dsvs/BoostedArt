## General Infos

The project was originally one of our first "real" experiences that we gained from our training at Promeo. In this sense, it was therefore extended to the last three months before the writing of this readme, which was done on January 4th, one week before the official release date of the website. 

As far as the functionalities are concerned, I refer you to the Documentation folder where you should find the specifications with all the information on this subject.

The first idea was quite simple: a website with the central idea of packages/bundles that you could buy artistic elements to inspire you on a subject, that's where the name of the site comes from, we "boost" the creativity of our customers, as for the logo in the form of a box, this naturally refers to our bundle system.

The bundles are divided by subject or more general themes such as "Cyberpunk" in which you will find elements specifically related to the theme, whether images, music, artworks, etc..

The peculiarity that was to distinguish us from our competitors comes from the fact that the website would mainly be fed by users/artists able to upload their own bundles while being able to earn a little money through this process, a small portion of the sum obtained being taken by the site to finance its existence. So if we had to put words to this formula, it would be a mix between Deviantart, Humblebundle and Fiverr.

The evocated release date for the project is the 9th of January.

## Collaborators

The different resources (the project members) were allocated by competence but also by the desire to work on a field, in order to guarantee a certain efficiency in the light of the project.

However, taking into account incidents and deadlines, we have in practice planned to interact with each other on assignments that were not originally ours. 

Our group is strong from a previous experience of cohesion through the "Adeya" project, which was a human resources management tool. 

Laure arrived later, as she joined us in the early days of Boosted'Art, but very quickly found her place to fill in the gaps in our group, which generally split into two sections of expertise: back-end and front-end.

### Clement DESAVIS

> Head of the previous project "ADEYA", Clément is our Swiss Army Knife with knowledge in most fields given his original background. Javascript questions and database reporting were his favourite areas where he was able to coordinate.

### Florian HERMEL

> Florian is our indicated back-end comrade, so he has been arranged together with Clément and Laure on SQL and database issues.

### Enzo DUPONT

> Enzo is one of the two front-end oriented collaborators in charge of the HTML and CSS realisation.

### Laure DELACHAPELLE

> Laure is our bridge between two worlds, she set up the specifications and worked on the different areas with the exception of CSS. So she worked as much with Jeremy for the documentation and with the latter plus Enzo for the front-end, as with Florian and Clément for the back-end.

### Jeremy PROVOST

> Jeremy is the last of our group, with several personal front-end experiences, he has put them to the group's advantage by setting up as a composer of the documentation and its translation in English and the graphical part, including the Logo for example, and has participated in the implementation of the CSS/HTML. He also took care of the implementation of the Gantt for team management.

## Further upgrades

There are many improvements to come, but we still lack the knowledge - and the time - to implement them. 

Among the options being considered are, for example : A optional bundle to change the visual of the website, a promotion page where you could find bundles in said promotion, and a dark mode for those who prefer a darker design.
