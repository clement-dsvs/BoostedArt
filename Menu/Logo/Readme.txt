The logo comes with a thin and subtle outline in pure white, this one is not perfect but it's there to make a little contrast.

Indeed as you can see because of the color pattern we'll have to put it on a "light" background, so pure white should make it more impactful.
I suggest to stay on the color chart, so we should use the "background color" you can see below.

Reminder of the color chart : 

Buttons : #d5a770
Frames : #202020
Background : #eeeeee
